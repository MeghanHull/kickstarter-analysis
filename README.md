# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louiseâ€™s play *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time.  The client has requested an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for how different Kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze how different Kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals, focusing on theater campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From the raw Kickstarter data, the "launch_at" date was converted from Unix timestamps to Gregorian calendar dates, and the "Category and Subcategory" field was parsed into two columns.  A pivot table was generated of campaign outcomes by month

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
